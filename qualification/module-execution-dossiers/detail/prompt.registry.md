# prompt.registry: implementation design

Parent: `docs/modules/prompt.registry/TECHNICAL.md`. Lane: `LANE-C-MEMORY`.
Status: specified target, not implemented or independently accepted. Common requirements: `../EXECUTION_SEMANTICS.md` and `../TECHNICAL.md`. Canonical ownership and package predecessors are unchanged.

## 1. Source and work envelope

Roots: `codex-rs/hepta-prompt-registry`.
Packages: `PIM-0-PROMPT-INTERVENTION-CONTRACTS`, `PIM-1-PROMPT-FACTOR-REGISTRY`.

Operation signatures below are design contracts, not assertions of existing native symbols. Bind each to an existing or planned symbol and consumer inside the owner envelope. Preserve existing stores and APIs; do not create another authority or execution spine.

## 2. Public operations and contract details

`admit_factor(factor, reviewed_scope) -> FactorRevision`; `register_realization(factor_revision, model_profile, payload_digest) -> RealizationRevision`; `revoke_factor(id, reason, cutoff) -> LifecycleReceipt`; `read_compatible(snapshot, model_tuple, context_profile) -> FactorSet`. Factor semantics and model-specific realization text are separate identities. External content must undergo governed admission before becoming an instruction factor.

## 3. State records and transaction design

`prompt_factor_registry` stores semantic factor ID, supported task classes, provenance and revision. `prompt_realization_registry` binds model/version/tokenizer/template/tool schema, locale, role, payload digest, token cost and expiry. `prompt_factor_lifecycle` stores proposed/admitted/revoked/retired transitions and supersession. Registry append and lifecycle publication are atomic for one owner revision; optimizer access is read-only.

## 4. Deterministic algorithm and scheduling

Validate source trust and owner authorization; dedupe semantic factors without merging incompatible realizations; validate model/template compatibility and payload bounds; append immutable revisions; publish lifecycle. Readers freeze one registry generation and reject expired or revoked realizations at delivery revalidation. No registry insertion automatically selects a factor in a running request.

## 5. Capacity and performance profile

Pilot candidate read <=128 factors, realization payload <=64 KiB subject to model-context limits, support references <=64 per factor. Count tokenizer cost under the exact selected tokenizer rather than character length. Measure lookup, lifecycle propagation and model-version fanout.

Pilot ceilings are design targets, not measurements. Stricter canonical limits prevail. Bind actual schema/migration, host and measurements before composition; stateless modules prove absence rather than inventing state.

## 6. Concrete verification cases

- PREG-01: same factor with incompatible tokenizer/template is not delivered by implicit fallback.
- PREG-02: untrusted page text cannot self-register as system instruction.
- PREG-03: revocation between optimization and delivery invalidates the selected realization.
- PREG-04: duplicate revision semantics are idempotent; changed payload under the same identity conflicts.

These are required product test designs, not executed-test receipts. Each implementation supplies native test identity, exact input/output and independent oracle evidence.

## 7. Integration, rollback and capability ceiling

KG holds rebuildable factor interactions; learning.ledger owns causal exposure/outcome, not this registry. Rollback may choose a compatible non-revoked predecessor, but never restore an old lifecycle snapshot before a revocation.

Use all eighteen dossier receipt fields. Immediate revocation/stop remains effective across frozen snapshots. Preserve every applicable external gate; no generator self-acceptance, self-merge or self-release.
