# cognitive.read: implementation design

Parent: `docs/modules/cognitive.read/TECHNICAL.md`. Lane: `LANE-C-MEMORY`.
Status: specified target, not implemented or independently accepted. Common requirements: `../EXECUTION_SEMANTICS.md` and `../TECHNICAL.md`. Canonical ownership and package predecessors are unchanged.

## 1. Source and work envelope

Roots: `codex-rs/hepta-cognitive-read`.
Packages: `MEM-READ-1-SNAPSHOT-PORT`.

Operation signatures below are design contracts, not assertions of existing native symbols. Bind each to an existing or planned symbol and consumer inside the owner envelope. Preserve existing stores and APIs; do not create another authority or execution spine.

## 2. Public operations and contract details

`acquire_snapshot(scope, source_frontiers, generations) -> SnapshotReadPort`; `read_ids(snapshot, ids, fields) -> BoundedReadResult`; `revalidate(packet, current_revocation_frontier) -> ValidatedAttachment | Stale`. No mutation/SQL-writer handle is exposed. Cross-owner reads bind a coherent declared cut and report missing/lagging owners explicitly.

## 3. State records and transaction design

No authoritative domain facts. Cache keys include principal/purpose, source/event revisions, tombstone frontier, KG/engram generation, encoder/preprocessor identity and requested fields. Cache values are bounded redacted projections. A read snapshot holds leases/pins on actual source generations and releases them on completion/cancellation.

## 4. Deterministic algorithm and scheduling

Authenticate purpose and scope before lookup; acquire the declared coherent source cut; fetch exact revisions; apply redaction and current revocation; return bounded facts with provenance. Before physical model-request attachment, revalidate the packet against one current compatible snapshot. Do not combine source rows from different frontiers because each individual read succeeded.

## 5. Capacity and performance profile

Pilot read <= 512 IDs and <= 1 MiB encoded result subject to context limits; snapshot lifetime <= the request deadline; cache bytes and pins are host-profile ceilings. A slow reader must expire or receive unavailable rather than hold unbounded history.

Pilot ceilings are design targets, not measurements. Stricter canonical limits prevail. Bind actual schema/migration, host and measurements before composition; stateless modules prove absence rather than inventing state.

## 6. Concrete verification cases

- READ-01: a packet becomes stale when one selected source revision or tombstone frontier changes.
- READ-02: cross-principal cache lookup is rejected even for equal query text.
- READ-03: cancellation releases read pins/descriptors without granting write access.
- READ-04: incomplete projection generation is reported unavailable, never presented as a complete snapshot.

These are required product test designs, not executed-test receipts. Each implementation supplies native test identity, exact input/output and independent oracle evidence.

## 7. Integration, rollback and capability ceiling

Implement the source-store reader adapter and fixture port against identical contracts. The no-owned-state test is required. Rollback invalidates incompatible cache/snapshot generations; cached reads cannot suppress immediate revocation.

Use all eighteen dossier receipt fields. Immediate revocation/stop remains effective across frozen snapshots. Preserve every applicable external gate; no generator self-acceptance, self-merge or self-release.
