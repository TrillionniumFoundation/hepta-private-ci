# runtime.codex: implementation design

Parent: `docs/modules/runtime.codex/TECHNICAL.md`. Lane: `LANE-B-RUNTIME`.
Status: specified target, not implemented or independently accepted. Common requirements: `../EXECUTION_SEMANTICS.md` and `../TECHNICAL.md`. Canonical ownership and package predecessors are unchanged.

## 1. Source and work envelope

Roots: `codex-rs/codex-app-server`, `codex-rs/hepta-codex-adapter`.
Packages: `P0.7B-B1B-MODEL-BOUNDARY`.

Operation signatures below are design contracts, not assertions of existing native symbols. Bind each to an existing or planned symbol and consumer inside the owner envelope. Preserve existing stores and APIs; do not create another authority or execution spine.

## 2. Public operations and contract details

`open_thread(authenticated_session, schema_version) -> ThreadHandle`; `submit_turn(thread, context_attachment, objective) -> TurnHandle`; `dispatch_tool(turn, final_call, verified_use) -> DispatchObservation`; `observe_delivery(turn, compiled_payload_digest) -> PromptDeliveryObservationV1`. Preserve the existing app-server protocol; model requests and tool calls are traced to this single high-level spine.

## 3. State records and transaction design

`thread_session` owns thread/turn identities, principal scope, selected model/runtime tuple, context digest, tool-schema digest, lifecycle and sequence. External effect outcomes remain with their observing adapters/operation ledger. Session event persistence must retain exact attachment/delivery links without copying secrets or unrestricted model payloads into general learning receipts.

## 4. Deterministic algorithm and scheduling

Validate thread generation and frozen objective; revalidate context evidence at physical request assembly; bind the actual template/tokenizer/tool schema; record delivery only when the exact payload is submitted; run model calls through governed inference; final-check tool authority and payload immediately before adapter entry. Provider timeout or lost acknowledgement is not automatically a safe retry.

## 5. Capacity and performance profile

Pilot turn attachment and output bounds follow the selected model/context profile; tool calls <= 128 candidates per boundary and dispatch concurrency is explicitly reserved. Measure template assembly, provider queue, first/last token and terminal-tool latency separately.

Pilot ceilings are design targets, not measurements. Stricter canonical limits prevail. Bind actual schema/migration, host and measurements before composition; stateless modules prove absence rather than inventing state.

## 6. Concrete verification cases

- CODEX-01: compiled-but-undelivered prompt cannot receive delivered-intervention credit.
- CODEX-02: payload changed after authorization is rejected at the effect gate.
- CODEX-03: unknown session/model/schema generation does not fall back to an ambient default.
- CODEX-04: acknowledgement loss keeps the operation indeterminate and does not create a duplicate model/tool effect.

These are required product test designs, not executed-test receipts. Each implementation supplies native test identity, exact input/output and independent oracle evidence.

## 7. Integration, rollback and capability ceiling

Boundary tests must use a named app-server caller, not only the adapter library. Preserve dependency inversion: the upstream execution spine consumes contracts rather than Hepta domain-store implementations. Rollback preserves thread compatibility and pending effect reconciliation.

Use all eighteen dossier receipt fields. Immediate revocation/stop remains effective across frozen snapshots. Preserve every applicable external gate; no generator self-acceptance, self-merge or self-release.
