# kernel.operations: implementation design

Parent: `docs/modules/kernel.operations/TECHNICAL.md`. Lane: `LANE-A-FOUNDATION`.
Status: specified target, not implemented or independently accepted. Common requirements: `../EXECUTION_SEMANTICS.md` and `../TECHNICAL.md`. Canonical ownership and package predecessors are unchanged.

## 1. Source and work envelope

Roots: `codex-rs/hepta-operations`.
Packages: `P0.7D-FAULT-MATRIX`.

Operation signatures below are design contracts, not assertions of existing native symbols. Bind each to an existing or planned symbol and consumer inside the owner envelope. Preserve existing stores and APIs; do not create another authority or execution spine.

## 2. Public operations and contract details

`prepare_intent(operation_id, owner, payload_digest, expected_predecessor) -> PreparedIntent`; `claim_outbox(operation_id, fence) -> DispatchClaim`; `observe_terminal(operation_id, observer_evidence) -> ReconciliationReceipt`. The same operation ID and semantic digest is idempotent; reuse with another payload is a conflict. Transport accepted/dispatched and independently observed applied/not-applied are different states.

## 3. State records and transaction design

`operation_ledger` keys scope+operation ID and records predecessor, payload, destination, state, writer fence, authority epoch and terminal-evidence digest. `cross_owner_outbox` keys destination+operation ID and records intent reference, claim fence, bounded attempts, next eligible time and acknowledgement watermark. Persist intent and local outbox atomically. Destination dedupe is owned by the destination and keyed by the same semantic identity.

## 4. Deterministic algorithm and scheduling

Local transaction -> durable intent/outbox -> fenced claim -> authorized adapter entry -> destination dedupe/apply -> terminal observation -> source settlement. After send/acknowledgement loss, mark indeterminate and reconcile; do not resend blindly. Stale workers cannot settle a newer attempt. State handoff uses the shared phased protocol and preserves unresolved-operation ownership.

## 5. Capacity and performance profile

Pilot pending intents <= 100000 per configured shard; claim batch <= 256; attempt counters bounded by operation profile; queue saturation rejects new work before mutation. Benchmark commit/fsync, outbox age and reconciliation backlog rather than only dispatch throughput.

Pilot ceilings are design targets, not measurements. Stricter canonical limits prevail. Bind actual schema/migration, host and measurements before composition; stateless modules prove absence rather than inventing state.

## 6. Concrete verification cases

- OPS-01: crash before intent commit yields no dispatch; crash after commit recovers exactly one outbox identity.
- OPS-02: acknowledgement loss remains indeterminate until trusted reconciliation.
- OPS-03: changed retry digest and stale writer fence conflict.
- OPS-04: disk-full/corrupt-frame/reopen and every handoff interruption preserve one authoritative writer and no duplicate terminal effect.

These are required product test designs, not executed-test receipts. Each implementation supplies native test identity, exact input/output and independent oracle evidence.

## 7. Integration, rollback and capability ceiling

Each adapter supplies its actual terminal observer and compensation semantics. Compensation is a new authorized operation. Restoring an old binary must preserve current revocation and pending effects; no rollback may invent a successful external outcome.

Use all eighteen dossier receipt fields. Immediate revocation/stop remains effective across frozen snapshots. Preserve every applicable external gate; no generator self-acceptance, self-merge or self-release.
