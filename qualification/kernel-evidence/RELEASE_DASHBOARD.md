## Canonical kernel.evidence status

This block is generated from
`qualification/kernel-evidence/STATUS_SOURCE.json` by
`python3 scripts/kernel_evidence_status.py sync`. Hand-written prose cannot
override these facts. Workflow receipts may prove the current candidate, but
cannot self-issue independent acceptance, deployment, canary or release.
