# Real Worker to Neuron ModelPort composition (shadow-only)

The Worker crate now implements WorkerNeuronControlPort, a synchronous
NeuronInferenceControlPort backed by the actual in-process InferenceWorker
and one **preexisting** WorkerRequest, not a self-issued resource grant.
It consumes this reservation exactly once on the first attempt, including
invalid identity, stale generation, mismatched payload, expired grant,
cancelled request, unknown terminal outcome, and backend error.

Execution follows this exact native chain:

pre-admitted WorkerRequest/ResourceGrant + already loaded ModelManifest
-> WorkerNeuronControlPort -> InferenceWorker::run_neuron_features_receipt
-> NeuronFeatureReceiptV1 -> InferenceControlModelPort
-> NeuronModelOutputV1 (Drive and Prediction Q24 separately)

The adapter enforces request ID, selected model ID, worker generation,
canonical feature payload versus both the lease/reservation digests, then
calls the real loaded Worker and verifies the complete typed receipt. It
never recreates a reservation or retries after a failed call. The Worker
enforces its current grant, loaded model tuple and memory envelope. Unknown
driver outcome is Indeterminate; malformed feature and identity mismatches
are rejected. This removes a previously missing source-level execution port.

The qualification tests run the actual Worker and the actual Neuron ModelPort,
with a **fixture ModelDriver** that produces deterministic Q24 vectors. This is
not proof of physical Laya safetensors, target CPU/GPU resources, signed
final-use or an observed NDU gain. No user text, labels or production CNS route
are used. The caller must separately authenticate and retain the resource
grant, reservation, trusted monotonic time, model-load CAS, generation fence
and selected route. Neither the presence of a syntactically valid WorkerRequest
nor the in-memory fixture grants any production authority.

The product Worker crate already depends on Agentd, which owns the Neuron
runtime. The new direct dependency on codex-hepta-neuron is downstream:
no reverse Agentd -> Worker runtime import and no second execution owner.
Shadow-only PR #1494 remains Draft. Production selection/NDU remain DENY_ALL.
