# Learning evaluation admission after consolidation

The restored Lane E source includes strict learned-operator fitting, immutable
dataset/admission receipts, and replayable final-holdout/lifecycle journals. The
journals implement semantic replay and expected-head checks; the host still owns
exclusive writing, fsync, crash recovery and a trusted persisted head. Their
existence is not evidence of a running long-term learner.

## Authenticated evidence boundary

`AuthenticatedPrincipalV1::validate`, the legacy evaluator and the V1/V2 dataset
receipt APIs validate supplied structure and digests. They do not authenticate an
external caller or prove that an estimate was produced by an independent actor.
They remain available for trusted in-process composition and compatibility.

External evaluation admission uses `decide_with_signed_evidence_v1` or
`decide_with_signed_evidence_v2`. The host constructs `LearningEvidenceVerifierV1`
from its authority store and distributes the resulting trust digest to signers.
Never construct that verifier from the same remote request being evaluated.

1. Register scoped Ed25519 public keys, role assignments, controlling authorities,
   credential lifetimes, objective and authority epoch in host-owned trust state.
2. Persist the frozen evaluation plan before accessing its holdout. The generator
   signs the frozen plan digest. Claimed signature timestamps do not prove the
   order of observations; the host's durable registration establishes that order.
3. The independent evaluator signs the exact `evaluation_signing_payload_v1/v2`
   bytes. These bind the entire supplied bundle and V2 metric-role contract.
4. Admission verifies the actual payload digest and signature, issuer assignment,
   role, scope, objective, epoch, lifetime and revocation, and rejects shared
   principal/key/credential/controller identities. A private verified type is
   produced only by this verifier. Rotate/revoke by replacing trusted state and
   reverify outstanding evidence; cached objects do not consult live revocations.
5. Run the existing frozen-plan, holdout, lineage, interval and claim checks.
   Preserve both the decision and its authentication/trust digests for audit.
   All resulting decisions retain `DENY_ALL` authority.

A signature proves an authorized key attested the bytes. It does not establish
unbiased measurement, honest controller registration, actual organizational
independence, valid confidence coverage or future learning gains. Data collection,
estimation and selection/promotion authorization remain separate host duties.
Exact signed-request replay is read-only evaluation; one-use holdouts remain the
registry/journal's responsibility. This does not replace AuthBus execution replay
protection or authorize effects.

## Preregistered metric roles

`freeze_cross_fold_plan_v2` assigns every metric exactly one role and requires at
least one primary objective. Directions, absolute bounds, roles and nonnegative
margins enter the sealed plan/metric digests before holdout consumption:

- `PrimarySuperiority`: conservative direction-adjusted improvement must strictly
  exceed the registered minimum improvement.
- `NonInferiority`: improvement may equal minus the maximum permitted regression.
- `AbsoluteConstraint`: the registered bound alone gates this metric. For a
  maximize metric it is a lower bound; for minimize it is an upper bound.

Existing absolute bounds apply to all roles. The V2 evaluator verifies the same
plan and metric contract; changing roles/margins or reinterpreting V2 with the
legacy all-superiority evaluator fails. Zero-event safety can remain at zero
while a primary utility improves. Simultaneous coverage and estimator validity
remain obligations of the supplied confidence evidence.

## Temporal claim limits

Current temporal fitting and per-fold lineage require distinct training and
holdout principals. This estimates generalization to previously unseen subjects;
it does not test whether the same subject improves through its own history.
The existing `SystemLongitudinal` requirements (multiple snapshots and future
windows, retention and unlearning receipts) are structural gates, not observed
long-term gains. No new learning level or benchmark gain is claimed here.

An individual-longitudinal protocol needs a separately registered estimand:
fixed subjects/cohort and baseline history; forward-only time splits permitting
shared subjects while excluding future decision/outcome/episode leakage;
policy/objective snapshots; dependency-aware subject or episode clusters (or
justified temporal blocks for one subject); independently measured future outcomes;
retention and unlearning after updates; and holdouts inaccessible to the learner.
Do not weaken the current cross-subject isolation to imitate this experiment.

## Capacity failure atomicity

`FinalHoldoutJournalV1::with_record_limit` exposes a host admission budget bounded
by the existing one-million-record ceiling. Capacity and sequence checks precede
registry mutation. Full journals still permit exact retries; a failed new request
changes neither journal nor registry digest. Snapshots keep their existing wire
shape. Hosts retaining a lower limit reopen through
`from_snapshot_with_record_limit`; the legacy constructor uses the original cap.
